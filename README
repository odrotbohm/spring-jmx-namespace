Small JMX namespace to allow setting up logger JMX beans with Spring
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This library allows exposing loggers to JMX to alter the log level at
runtime for example. Currently it supports Log4J as actual logging
runtime only but I am open to add other ones if there's demand.

To get an impression of how you can use the library take a look at
jmx-logger.xml in the test tree. There you can find a logger like this:

<jmx:logger type="Log4J" name="org.springframework" />

Combined with the <context:mbean-server /> and <context:mbean-exporter />
this will register the logger for org.springframework as JMX MBean. To
see it working live simply run the Sample class, and open a JConsole or
the like, find the LoggerDynamicMBean and alter the log level to DEBUG.
Pressing Enter in the console should give you a sample DEBUG level
message then.
